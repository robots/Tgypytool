This directory contains tools to "hack", modify the firmware. 

dumper - contains alternative firmware, that will dump the internal flash of the
 8051 cpu. This was used to get the bootloader code out for study. You will
 need SDCC compiler and as.py tool from "tools" dir.

tools - as.py, and dis.py. Assembler and disassembler for the DLC firmware files.

fw-mod - my attempt to modify the behaviour of the "adaptive throttle" range, that
 causes trouble in noisy environment. Changes I made are somewhat commented. 
 You will need as31 assembler software from http://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/
