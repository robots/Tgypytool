Toolkit for Turnigy Super Brain ESC 
By: Michal Demin <michal.demin@gmail.com>
--------------------------------------------------

This toolkit has been created to help people work with this ESC
in environment other than Win32 (developed on linux). Few features 
have not yet been implemented.

What is working:
- configuration read/write (creates nice TEXT config file)
- log read/clear
- DLC file parsing, creating

To be tested:
- firmware upload
- graphing tool
 
To be added:
- correct scales for graphs
- log parameter changing (only needs user interface)


What you will need:
- kernel support for cp210x
- python
- python modules - matplotlib, pyserial

usage:
tgypytool.py -p PORT [-v] [-e] [-c config_to_set] [-o read_config] [-f firmware_to_flash] [-l logfile_prefix]

-p - port where the ESC sits (/etc/ttyUSB0)
-v - verbose
-e - erase log
-c file - reads file and sets parameters accordingly
-o file - reads parameters and writes them into file
-f file - writes firmware from file (EXPERIMENTAL)
-l log  - reads device log, and writes several log[1-9] files
