--------------------------------------------------

This toolkit has been created to help people work with this ESC
in environment other than Win32. Few features have not yet been 
implemented.

What is working:
- configuration read/write (creates nice TEXT config file)
- log read/clear
- DLC file parsing, creating

To be tested:
- firmware upload
- graphing tool
 
To be added:
- correct scales for graphs
- log parameter changing (only needs user interface)
